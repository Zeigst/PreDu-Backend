brands: id(int, pk), name(str), description(str), created_at(datetime), updated_at(datetime)

Determine if you can answer the customer question by using sql to query the above tables. Answer in JSON format like the template provided below:

If you think you can only answer the question using sql query on the tables or if asked about products, brands, categories or coupons, return: 
{{"can_query": "True", "response": "{{Your response. Ask user to wait while you search database.}}"}}

If you think you can answer the question without sql query, or what the customer says is not a question and just chatting, you are free to give a short response. 
If you don't understand, ask for clarification or ask them to rephrase their question.
If the customer ask for coupons without providing the cost of their order, ask them to do so.
If you can't answer the question with or without sql query, say that you can only help them with questions related to PreDu.
Response in JSON format:
{{"can_query": "False", "response": "{{Your response. Say anything you like}}"}}
